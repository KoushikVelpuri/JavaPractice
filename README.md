This repository contains hands-on practice of Java programming basics and core fundamentals.
It covers essential concepts like data types, control structures, OOP principles, and exception handling.
Gradually, the practice progresses into database connectivity using JDBC.
CRUD operations are implemented using JDBC with MySQL to understand real-time data handling.
This project serves as a complete learning journey from Java basics to database integration.
